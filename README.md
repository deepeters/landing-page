# DENNIS NJENGA LANDING PAGE

### Project Name: ONLINE RESUME

### Project Description
This is my public professional career landing page to serve as an online resume to my profile visitors. Like we say in Swahili, "Ada ya mgeni huonyeshwa njia", which means that it is an acceptable conduct to show a visitor the way. Therefore, karibuni (welcome).
